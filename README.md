# practical-html-and-css-course
This project was created following the basic course "Curso Practico de Frontend Developer" by Platzi and it's part of a group of courses to become a frontend developer.   It's about a bike shop website. Each view was created using HTML and CSS to learn how to use different tags and styles, and then we are going to complement it using javascript.
